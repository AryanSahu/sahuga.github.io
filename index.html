        Have you ever tried to test Protobuf in a browser?

Protobuf is a binary data format that requires a special parser to read and write data,making it unsuitable for browsers that typically work with text-based data formats.

However, you can still work with Protobuf data in a browser environment by using JavaScript libraries like protobuf.js or protobuf-ts. These libraries provide the necessary functionality
 to encode and decode Protobuf messages in JavaScript.

Another option is to use a tool like Google's Protobuf Web Editor, which is a web-based editor that allows you to test and validate Protobuf messages in a browser environment.

It provides a user interface  for creating and editing Protobuf messages, as well as a validation feature that checks your messages for errors and compliance with your schema.

In summary, while you cannot test Protobuf directly in a browser due to its binary format, there are some tools available that can help you work with Protobuf data in a browser environment. Check out these options and see which one works best for you!
